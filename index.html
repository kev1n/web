    <h2> CPU </h2> <!-- Each TOC has its own header 2 with its name, and a paragraph including links to the articles, and a brief description of what each part does. -->
    <p> Every computer has a <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/694869/what-is-a-cpu-and-what-does-it-do/"> CPU</a>. It stands for "central processing unit" and is responsible for interpreting and processing almost all of the instructions given to the computer. <br> Think of it as tiny, compact computer.</p>
    <h2> Motherboard </h2>
    <p> The <a href="https://computer.howstuffworks.com/motherboard.htm"> motherboard</a> is the sheet of metal that connects all of the parts of the computer together and allows them to communicate. <br> Without it, the computer will not be able to work together, much less work at all. <p>
    <h2> RAM </h2>
    <p> <a href="https://techguided.com/what-is-ram-what-does-it-do/"> RAM</a> (or random access memory), is responsible for storing data on a short-term basis, and allows the data to be fetched quickly. <br> Think about all the tabs and programs you have open right now. Without RAM to keep them cached, you wouldn't be able to access them in the blink of an eye, much less even open them at all. </p>
    <h2> Storage </h2>
    <p> There two common types of storage used in today's computers, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/ssd-vs-hdd-whats-the-difference"> SSDs and HDDs</a> Both have the ability to store data for the long-term, such as when your computer is turned off. <br> However, SSDs (or solid state drive), tend to be much faster than their older counterpart, HDDs (or a hard drive disk). </p>
    <h2> GPU </h2>
    <p> <a href="https://www.hellotech.com/blog/whats-a-gpu-what-gpu-do-you-have"> GPU </a> (or graphics processing unit), is a special type of computer chip that works together with the CPU to render graphics for the computer. <br> If you're watching youtube or gaming, (or even running complex computer simulations) then you certainly need a good one! </p>
    <h2> Power supply </h2>
    <p> The <a href="https://www.actpower.com/educational/what-is-a-power-supply-and-how-does-it-work/#:~:text=Electrical%20outlets%20deliver%20alternating%20current,the%20AC%20power%20into%20DC."> power supply </a> is responsible for directing electrial power from the electrial source to every single component of the computer. <br> It regulates the voltages of the power to protect the computer from undervoltage and overvoltage</p>
    <h2> Case </h2>
    <p> The <a href="https://www.pchardwarehelp.com/case.php">case, or chassis </a> physically contains all the parts of a computer. <br> It it not necessary for a computer to work, but it helps keep airflow into the system for cooling, exhuasts out the hot air for the computer parts, and traps out dust. All good cases have slots for small fans to keep the parts cool. </p>
